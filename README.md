CreditCardInfo
==============

Auto-filling form fields from new NFC credit cards application. It is a final-year project side application. 

The idea is to help people enter some informations when they pay on a website : their credit card number, its expiration date and the card owner name. Especially on Android devices, this technology is relevant to improve web purchasing quality and rapidity. This application targets the latest NFC credit cards.

The goal is to let people auto-fill payment fields on the internet by putting their NFC credit card on the back of their device.
Indeed, when you purchase something on a website, you need to enter your credit card number, the expiration date and the 3-digit CVC code. In fact, a lot of errors may occur because of wrong entries, failure at reading or erased data.
This application just demonstrate that extracting the relevant information from your NFC credit card may be done. It might be integrated later in some bigger project and be involved in our future purchases one dayâ€¦
